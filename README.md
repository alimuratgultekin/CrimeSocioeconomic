## Crime Rate and Socioeconomic Factors

## Motivation
This project's aim is to explore if there is a correlation between crime rates and socioeconomic factors like income, previous education and more...

## Data Sources
In this project I will use multiple public data
- **Socioeconomic Data**:Word Bank Reports on income, education and employement
- **Data Related to Crime**: FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting database or Kaggle's public crime database
- **Extra Data**: Neighborhood safety data and housing price data

## Data Collection Plan
1. Find crime rate statistics from a public platform
2. Collect socioeconomic data, for the regions I looked for crime rates.(so that they can be related)
3. Use both of the datasets based on locations to analyze a relationship
4. Perform data cleaning based on the result
